README - Example Configuration for procwatch
============================================

Prerequisites:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    PEAR::XML::Parser
    PEAR::Console::Getopt

Running the example configuration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the example, just type the following on your shell prompt:

# procwatch -x example.xml && tail /var/log/procwatch

The example configuration looks for running httpd processes and their memory
usage. You should see an entry in /var/log/procwatch for "httpd-count" if you
are running less than 10 or more than 30 httpd processes. You also should see 
an entry if all httpd processes use more than 5% of physical memory available.
The provided example configuration also looks for running processes and zombies.
Please have a look at example.xml for a short introduction.
